        <h2>Mars Set to Receive Dual Attention</h2>
        <p>Mars is about to receive a double dose of attention. This weekend, a pair of identical NASA satellites will launch together to help reveal how the Red Planet lost its thick atmosphere and liquid water — one of its oldest mysteries, and a key to understanding how it transformed from a once-habitable world into the frozen desert it is today.</p>
        
        <h2>Launch Details and Mission Purpose</h2>
        <p>Scheduled for liftoff no earlier than Sunday (Nov. 9) aboard Blue Origin's <u>New Glenn rocket</u> from Cape Canaveral, Florida, the twin <a href="#">ESCAPADE mission</a> — short for Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers — will send two probes, nicknamed Blue and Gold, to orbit Mars in tandem. The mission marks NASA's first-ever satellite mission to another planet, and aims to create a 3D view of how the solar wind, the stream of charged particles from the sun, shredded and strips away Martian air.</p>
        <p>"To understand how the solar wind drives different kinds of atmospheric escape is a key piece of the puzzle of the climate evolution of Mars," <a href="#">Robert Lillis</a>, principal investigator for ESCAPADE and associate director for planetary science at the University of California, Berkeley's Space Sciences Laboratory, said in a <a href="#">statement</a>. "Like two eyes give you depth perception, or two ears give you what you might call a stereo perspective — two different vantage points simultaneously."</p>
        <p>Geologic evidence from ancient river valleys and water-formed minerals shows that Mars <u>once had liquid water</u>, which means it also had a much thicker atmosphere. But around 4 billion years ago, the planet's magnetic field, which is the invisible shield that protects a world from the sun's radiation, began to fade. Without that protection, the solar wind slowly <u>stripped away the Martian atmosphere</u>, leaving behind a tenuous wisp less than 1% as dense as Earth's.</p>
